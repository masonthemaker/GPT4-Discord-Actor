GPT-4 Discord Bot
This is a Discord bot powered by OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The bot reads messages from the #general channel and responds in real-time, providing responses that are based on the instructions given to it at the beginning of each conversation. You can specify who the AI should act as through the 'role' and 'content' under the system message.

Setup
Follow the steps below to set up and run the bot:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Make sure you have Python installed. This script has been tested with Python 3.8, but other 3.x versions should also work.

Install the required Python packages. You can do this by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your command line. The required packages are discord.py and openai.

Replace "your_openai_api_key" and "your_discord_token" in the script with your OpenAI API key and Discord bot token respectively.

Run the bot by navigating to the directory containing the script and running python bot.py (replace bot.py with the name of your Python script if you've renamed it).

Usage
Once the bot is running and connected to your Discord server, it will automatically read and respond to messages sent in the #general channel. The bot will not respond to its own messages or messages in any other channels.

The bot uses the OpenAI GPT-4 model to generate responses. It follows the instructions specified in the 'content' under the system message at the beginning of the conversation.

Error Handling
If an error occurs while running a command, the bot will print the error to your console and also send a message in Discord with the error. This should help with diagnosing and fixing any issues that might occur.

Customization
You can customize the bot's behavior by changing the instructions given to it in the 'content' under the system message in the on_message event handler. You can specify the role the AI should play, the scope of its knowledge, and any other constraints on its behavior.

For example, if you wanted the AI to act as a Shakespearean character, you could change the instructions to something like this:

{
    "role": "system",
    "content": "You are an expert AI playing the role of a Shakespearean character. Your language should reflect the styles used in 16th-century English literature. Always stay in character, and provide responses as if you are a character in a play by William Shakespeare."
}
The possibilities are virtually endless, and you can adjust the behavior to fit your specific needs.
